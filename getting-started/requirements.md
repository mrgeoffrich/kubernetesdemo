# Requirements

## Hardware Requirements

You will need a VM or bare metal server, that has at least 16GB of RAM and 2 cores.

This machine must also have network connectivity to your LAN and should be reachable on the LAN as well. Make sure it is sitting on the same network as your host for simplicity sake.&#x20;

## Cloud Requirements

To automate DNS and TLS certificates you will need an Azure account with a DNS zone set up and working.

## Software Requirements

You will need a machine to operate from, this can be a Linux, Mac or Windows machine. My machine is a windows machine but all the steps will work just as well on a linux or mac, you might just need to vary the instructions slightly when installing the applications.
